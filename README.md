### Food Review Sentiment Detection using Logistic Regression And Decision Tree Classifier

- This project focuses on building a logistic regression model to detect sentiment in food reviews. The model classifies reviews as positive or negative based on the textual content.


- The dataset used in this project consists of food reviews sourced from Kaggle. Each review is labeled with a sentiment, either positive or negative.

- The model is built using logistic regression, a simple yet effective method for binary classification problems. Logistic regression predicts the probability of a categorical dependent variable based on one or more predictor variables.

#### Text preprocessing is a vital initial step in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to prepare raw text data for analysis by machine learning models. Several techniques improve the quality and usability of the text:

- Lowercasing: Converting all text to lowercase ensures consistency and avoids treating "Text" and "text" as different words. This standardization helps models focus on the meaning of words rather than case variations.

- Removing Punctuation and Special Characters: Punctuation (.,?!) and special characters (@, $, %) can introduce noise for NLP models. Removing them simplifies the data and allows models to concentrate on the core content.

- Stop-Word Removal: Stop words (the, a, an, is, etc.) are common but hold limited meaning in NLP tasks. By removing them, we can reduce data size and focus on the more informative words that convey the essence of the text.

- Tokenization: Breaking down text into individual words or meaningful units (tokens) is a fundamental step for many NLP tasks. This process allows models to analyze the text grammatically and semantically, leading to better comprehension.
